# Description

This repository contains a full-stack application built with NestJS for the backend API and Angular for the frontend. The application demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing posts, along with user authentication and signup features. PostgreSQL is used as the database to store the data.

The project is divided into two main parts: the **backend** and the **frontend**. Each part has its own README with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the application.

## Backend (NestJS)

The backend of the application is built using NestJS, a powerful and modular Node.js framework. It provides the API endpoints required for managing posts and user authentication.

For more information and instructions on setting up and running the backend, please refer to the [Backend README](backend/README.md).

## Frontend (Angular)

The frontend of the application is built using Angular, a popular front-end framework. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API, displaying posts, and managing user authentication.

For more information and instructions on setting up and running the frontend, please refer to the [Frontend README](frontend/README.md).

## Technologies Used

- Backend: NestJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS

## Getting Started

To run the entire application, you will need to follow the setup instructions provided in both the backend and frontend README files.

1. Set up the **backend** by following the instructions in the [Backend README](backend/README.md).
2. Set up the **frontend** by following the instructions in the [Frontend README](frontend/README.md).

Once both the backend and frontend are set up and running, you can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to the specified URL.
